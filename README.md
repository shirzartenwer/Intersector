# Intersector App Built in Python

This intersector app is built with Python. UI componenent is provided by [streamlit library](https://streamlit.io/), a Python based UI library. The structure of this repo looks like the following:


```
Intersector
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── src
    ├── app.py
    ├── Core
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── conftest.py
    │   ├── Tests
    │   └── two_collection_intersector.py
    └── Tests
        └── test_app.py
```

## To run the app

First clone the git repository

```
git clone git@github.com:shirzartenwer/Intersector.git
cd OptravisHomework
```

### first option

Then to run the app, they easiest option is to 
```
docker compose up
```
### second option
If you have VScode, then do:

```
code .
```

Then `ctrl/cmd + shift + P` and open this repo in `devcontainer`. 
Then do 
```
streamlit run src/app.py
``` 
to run the app. 



## Run tests and see test coverage
Open this code repo in `devcontainer` in VScode. Then run 
```
pytest
```

To see the test coverage run: 

```
coverage report 
```


## Disclaimer

Since this app uses standard UI component provided by streamlit, some of the default behavior of these UI component is not explicitly tested in this repo.

For example, when a number smaller or bigger than threshold is given into the input field as the size of the collections, there is pop up warning window generated by streamlit. But the way to access this window is not exposed via the UI componnet. So this behavior is not explicitly tested in this repo, but relies on streamlit's own testing of its own library components.

I also considered using Pydantic for input validation. But since Streamlit took care of the front end input validaiton, the added value of using Pydantic was not so high, so I didn't further complicate the code base.
